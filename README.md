# techvideos

## Idea
The idea behind this project is creating a social network where people can link videos from conferences.
Right now, it looks as every conference is uploading their videos to different platforms like, youtube, vimeo or even
their own website. This makes it hard for us to keep track of them.

By having a website like this, people on the community will be able to link all those videos here and label them
relevant tags so they can be easily depending found based on what you are looking for.

The project is not interested in hosting the videos for now, it will send users to the video page.

The name of the social network is still pending to be decided.

## Help is wanted
I would like that his project is built for the community as an open source project. Everybody is welcome on board. Just
fire an email to estringana@gmail.com and I will reply to you ASAP.

Right now, it would be much appreciated frontend help (Not my best skill)

## What's is next?
The project is using github tools to managing everything. You can find what's on the TODO list here
